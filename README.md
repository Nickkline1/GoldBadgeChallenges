# GoldBadgeChallenges

# These are the 3 Console Apps for the Gold Badge final challenge

The First challenge was "Cafe"
The Second Challenge was "Claims"
The Third Challenge was "Badges"
All 3 challenges use the CRUD method, and include tests. 


## Installation

All the challenges are written in C#, opened in Microsoft Visual Studio, and are organized in a similar fashion, A Class Project, a Unit
Test Project, and the Console App that corresponds.

All challenges can be accessed at https://github.com/Nickkline1/GoldBadgeChallenges

Challenge One is a build of a console app for the "Dragon Cafe" manager to update the cafe menu. Meal numbers,

Challenge Two is a build of a console app for Komodo Insurance Claims Department. It allows the adjuster to see claims,
process the claim, and enter new claims.
